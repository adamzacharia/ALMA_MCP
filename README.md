# ALMA MCP Server - Astronomical Data Access via Natural Language

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides comprehensive access to the ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array) archive through a clean, extensible architecture.

## Vision

This MCP server transforms ALMA archive queries from a software engineering problem into a **natural language conversation**. Instead of learning TAP/ADQL syntax and archive APIs, researchers simply ask for what they need and get clean, analysis-ready results.


**The result**: AI assistants that can seamlessly search ALMA data by target, position, frequency, resolution, or any custom criteria

## Quick Setup for Claude Desktop

### 1. Clone/Copy and Setup Environment

> **IMPORTANT: Change the paths below according to YOUR installation location!**

```bash
# Clone the repository (or copy the ALMA_MCP folder)
git clone https://github.com/adamzacharia/ALMA_MCP.git
cd ALMA_MCP

# Create a dedicated conda environment with Python 3.11+
conda create -n alma_mcp python=3.11
conda activate alma_mcp

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install astronomical libraries for full functionality
pip install fastmcp alminer pyvo astroquery astropy pandas
```

**Alternative: Using venv instead of conda:**
```bash
# Navigate to the ALMA_MCP folder
cd path/to/ALMA_MCP

# Create a dedicated venv environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Test the Server

```bash
# Test basic functionality
python test_server.py

# Quick test (optional)
python -c "
from server import get_alma_info, ALMINER_AVAILABLE, PYVO_AVAILABLE
print(' Server loads successfully')
print(f' alminer available: {ALMINER_AVAILABLE}')
print(f' pyvo available: {PYVO_AVAILABLE}')
"
```

### 3. Configure Claude Desktop

Find and edit the Claude Desktop MCP configuration file:

1. Navigate to your Claude Desktop AppData folder:
   - **Windows**: Open File Explorer and go to `%APPDATA%\Claude\`
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/`

2. Find the file named `config.json` 

3. Add the following configuration to the file:

> **IMPORTANT: Change the path below according to YOUR installation location!**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "alma": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["c:/Users/Asus/Desktop/Quasar-main/ALMA_MCP/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note**: Use forward slashes `/` in paths even on Windows.

#### Using a Custom Environment (Conda or venv)

If you installed the dependencies in a **conda environment** or **venv**, you MUST specify the full path to that environment's Python executable. Otherwise the system won't find the installed packages!

**For Conda environment:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "alma": {
      "command": "C:/Users/YourName/anaconda3/envs/alma_mcp/python.exe",
      "args": ["c:/path/to/ALMA_MCP/server.py"],
      "cwd": "c:/path/to/ALMA_MCP",
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

To find your conda environment's Python path, run:
```bash
conda activate alma_mcp
where python    # Windows
which python    # Mac/Linux
```

**For venv:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "alma": {
      "command": "c:/path/to/ALMA_MCP/venv/Scripts/python.exe",
      "args": ["c:/path/to/ALMA_MCP/server.py"],
      "cwd": "c:/path/to/ALMA_MCP",
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```


### 4. Restart and Test

1. **Quit Claude Desktop completely** (right-click system tray → Quit)
2. **Check Task Manager** - If Claude is still running in the background, end the task
3. **Reopen Claude Desktop**
4. **Test with a query** like:
   - "Search ALMA for observations of M87"
   - "Find high-resolution ALMA data with resolution under 0.5 arcseconds"
   - "What are ALMA's frequency bands?"

### 5. Troubleshooting

**Server won't start:**
```bash
# Check Python environment
python --version  # Should be 3.10+

# Test server manually
python server.py
# Should start without errors
```

**MCP connection issues:**
- Verify the Python path in your config is correct
- Ensure all dependencies are installed
- Check that `server.py` exists at the specified path

**Missing dependencies:**
```bash
pip install fastmcp alminer pyvo astroquery astropy pandas
```

## Using with Other LLMs and Frameworks

### LangChain Integration

You can use this MCP server with LangChain using the `langchain-mcp-adapters` package:

```bash
pip install langchain-mcp-adapters
```

```python
from langchain_mcp_adapters.client import MCPClient
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Connect to the MCP server
client = MCPClient(
    command="python",
    args=["path/to/ALMA_MCP/server.py"]
)

# Get tools from MCP server
tools = client.get_tools()

# Use with any LangChain-compatible LLM
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4")
llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)
```

### Open Source LLMs

For open source LLMs (Ollama, LMStudio, etc.), you can:

1. **Use MCP-compatible clients**: Some open source projects like [MCP CLI](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/cli) support connecting MCP servers to local LLMs.

2. **Direct function calling**: Import the server functions directly in your Python code:

```python
from server import search_alma_by_target, search_alma_by_position, get_alma_info

# Use tools directly
result = search_alma_by_target("M87", search_radius_arcmin=5.0)
print(result)

# Get ALMA reference info
info = get_alma_info()
print(info)
```

3. **Build a REST API**: Wrap the MCP tools in a FastAPI/Flask server for any LLM that supports function calling via HTTP.
